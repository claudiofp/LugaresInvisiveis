Invisible Places is a work of urban artistic intervention using mobile digital technology. The intervention consists of an application that allows you to record audio content geolocalizado. The application allows (a) user () to write short statements on specific points of the map. These recordings can then be heard by other (s) user (s) that have the application installed, provided that the user (a) visit the exact same point on the map. This work is part of the dissertation Koji Pereira for the Masters of Art and Image Technology's School of Fine Arts (UFMG). Driven by Carlos Falci and co-created by Claudio Fernando Pinto. In Places Unseen sought to create a tool that encourages the drift and the record of statements about different areas of the city. Here the map of the space designed functions only as a geographical reference, the most important record of the testimony of lived space. The immediate inspiration of the work are the Situationists, the "moments" of Henri Lefebvre, the virtual Pierre LÃ©vy's critique of David Harvey and convivencialidade Ivan Illich.
